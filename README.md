# bookmarks-reminder
I saw an interesting article on Monday, I wanted to read through and take some notes, so I bookmarked it and promised myself I would read it on Wednesday. 4 months later, I accidentally open my bookmarks tab and I see the link to that article. Crap! I forgot about this. This is to help me reduce the "Crap! I forgot about this" moments.
